# MQTT Media Player v2.0

**‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes in v2.0** - This version implements the [`ha-mqtt-discoverable`](https://github.com/shyndman/ha-mqtt-discoverable) MediaPlayer specification with automatic feature detection. See [Migration Guide](docs/migration-guide.md) for upgrade instructions.

A Home Assistant custom integration that provides MQTT-based media player entities with full discovery support and comprehensive feature detection.

## Features

- **üéõÔ∏è Comprehensive Controls** - Play, pause, stop, seek, volume, mute, shuffle, repeat
- **üì± Advanced Features** - Source selection, sound modes, turn on/off, playlist management
- **üéµ Rich Metadata** - Title, artist, album, duration, position, album art, episode info
- **üîó Multi-room Support** - Group member tracking for multi-room audio systems
- **‚ö° Dynamic Features** - Only shows controls supported by your device
- **üì∫ Multi-media Support** - Music, video, podcasts, TV shows with appropriate metadata

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=shyndman&repository=ha-mqtt-media-player&category=integration)

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/mqtt_media_player` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via the UI

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mqtt_media_player)

## Quick Start

### Option 1: MQTT Discovery (Recommended)

For devices implementing the [`ha-mqtt-discoverable`](https://github.com/shyndman/ha-mqtt-discoverable) MediaPlayer specification, discovery is automatic. Just publish your configuration:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -t "homeassistant/media_player/my_player/config" -m '{
  "name": "My Music Player",
  "unique_id": "my_player_001",
  "state_topic": "myplayer/state",
  "media_title_topic": "myplayer/title",
  "media_artist_topic": "myplayer/artist",
  "volume_level_topic": "myplayer/volume",
  "play_topic": "myplayer/play",
  "pause_topic": "myplayer/pause",
  "volume_set_topic": "myplayer/volume_set"
}'
```

The device will automatically appear in Home Assistant with play, pause, and volume controls enabled.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Add the integration via Home Assistant UI and enter your device name. The integration will attempt to fetch the configuration from MQTT.

## Device Implementation

### Using ha-mqtt-discoverable Library

The easiest way to create compatible devices is using the [`ha-mqtt-discoverable`](https://github.com/shyndman/ha-mqtt-discoverable) Python library:

```python
from ha_mqtt_discoverable import Settings, DeviceInfo  
from ha_mqtt_discoverable.media_player import MediaPlayer, MediaPlayerInfo

# Configure your media player
player_info = MediaPlayerInfo(
    name="My Player",
    device=DeviceInfo(name="My Device", identifiers="my_device"),
)

settings = Settings(mqtt=mqtt_settings, entity=player_info)
player = MediaPlayer(settings, command_callbacks)

# Update state
player.set_state("playing")
player.set_title("Current Song")
player.set_volume(0.75)
```

### Manual Implementation

If implementing your own device, publish configuration to:
```
homeassistant/media_player/{device_name}/config
```
